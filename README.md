Practice Speaking a Foreign Language with AI

This project leverages Flask, Bootstrap, and GeminiPro 1.0 to construct a comprehensive AI-driven language learning application, building upon the foundational work of LinguaLearn (https://github.com/KhanradCoder/LinguaLearn) by Adam Eubanks (https://github.com/KhanradCoder). I would like to acknowledge Mr. Eubanks's contributions and express my gratitude for providing the foundation for VerbalEase.

Key Enhancements:

* Aesthetic Refinements: Implemented CSS modifications.
* Language Expansion: Incorporated Vietnamese and Brazilian Portuguese language options.
* Audio Playback: Integrated functionality enables users to listen to both the chatbot's and their own voice recordings.
* Interactive Enhancements: Added icons for audio playback of the chatbot's and user's last responses.
* Conversation Archiving: Introduced a feature to save conversations as a PDF document.

This application is designed for local deployment and is optimized to function within Google Chrome. While it may be possible to access the application using other browsers or operating systems, certain features and functionalities may be limited or unavailable.

## Usage 
* Locate the file named ```config.ini```
* Add your Gemini API token to ```config.ini```
* Run the app with ```flask run```
